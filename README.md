# Prediction-of-Cardiovascular-Disease
This project predicts cardiovascular disease using patient health data. It involves exploratory data analysis to understand variables like age and gender, visualization of feature distributions, and training machine learning models. Model interpretability with LIME is applied to explain predictions and support healthcare decisions.
