# Prediction-of-Cardiovascular-Disease
This project predicts cardiovascular disease using patient health data. It involves exploratory data analysis to understand variables like age and gender, visualization of feature distributions, and training machine learning models. Model interpretability with LIME is applied to explain predictions and support healthcare decisions.
## Dataset

Features include:

* Age
* Gender
* Blood pressure
* Cholesterol
* Other health indicators
* Target: presence or absence of cardiovascular disease

## Installation

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn lime joblib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Predicting heart disease.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook step by step to explore data, train models, and evaluate results

## Results

The models classify patients with or without cardiovascular disease. LIME provides explanations for individual predictions, helping improve transparency and trust.
